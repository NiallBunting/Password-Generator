<h1>DDPG - Data Derived Password Generator</h1><br/>
<h2>Based on data you input.</h2>

<p>
This was done by me <a href="niallbunting.com">Niall Bunting</a>, because the problem with normal password generators is that they have to store the random password they generate for you. 
</p>
<p>
I thought that it should be able to be generated based on data. I reccon its better then using the same password. 
Also according to this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SkdP36wiAU">TED talk</a>, 16 character passwords are secure as long as they are random.

<p>
This is all done on client side, so i'm not stealing your password. If you want to check, go to <a href="https://github.com/nazerb/Password-Generator">github</a>.
